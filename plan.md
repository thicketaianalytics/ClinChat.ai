### ✅ What's Been Built:

**AI Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Dual-provider AI client (Gemini + Claude)
- ✅ Automatic provider detection with fallback
- ✅ Response caching system
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ AIState with event handlers

**AI Features Ready:**
- ✅ Trial AI summarization UI (trial detail page)

- ✅ Loading states and error messages
- ✅ Provider attribution display

### 📋 API Status:
- **Google Gemini**: ❌ Quota exceeded (free tier limit reached)
  - 41 models available
  - Using: gemini-2.0-flash (when credits available)

### 🎯 How It Works:
1. **Auto-Detection**: System tries Gemini first, then Claude
2. **Graceful Fallback**: If one fails, automatically tries the other
3. **Smart Caching**: Responses cached to reduce API usage
4. **User Feedback**: Shows which AI provider generated each response

### 🚀 Ready to Use When You Add Credits:
Simply top up **either** Gemini **or** Claude credits, and the system will:
- ✅ Automatically detect which provider has credits
- ✅ Generate AI summaries for any trial
- ✅ Create comparison insights for 2-5 trials
- ✅ Cache responses to save on API costs
- ✅ Fall back to the other provider if quota exceeded

### 📝 Next Steps:
